# LecBuddy
LecBuddy is a productivity-focused Chrome extension specifically engineered for students at the NUS. It serves as an intelligent academic companion that bridges the gap between passive video watching and active learning by automating the transcription and summarization of lectures hosted on the NUS Panopto platform.

The core mission of LecBuddy is to help students reclaim their time. By transforming long-form video content into structured, searchable text, it allows for efficient revision and quick referencing of complex lecture material.
